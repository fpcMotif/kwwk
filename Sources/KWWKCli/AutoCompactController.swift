/// Watches each turn's reported token usage and triggers
/// `performCompact` when the transcript approaches the model's
/// `contextWindow`. Two trigger paths:
///
///   - **Between sub-turns** (`maybeCompactInline`): wired as
///     `agent.betweenTurns`, so the loop pauses between LLM calls long
///     enough to summarize the transcript in place. Blocks the next
///     request until the recap is ready — user input typed during this
///     window goes into the normal steering queue and drains at the
///     next turn boundary.
///   - **Post-agentEnd** (`observe`): when a run finishes with the
///     final turn past threshold, a detached Task waits for the agent
///     lifecycle to unwind, runs the compact, and drains any queued
///     steering messages via `agent.continue()` so a prompt the user
///     typed during the compact actually runs afterward.
///
/// Usage math:
///   tokens  = last assistant `usage.input + output + cacheRead + cacheWrite`
///   window  = `agent.state.model.contextWindow`
///   ratio   = tokens / window
///
/// All four usage components are summed because providers with prompt
/// caching (Anthropic, OpenAI Responses/Codex) report only the uncached
/// portion of the prompt in `input`; the cached portion lives in
/// `cacheRead` (and any fresh cache writes in `cacheWrite`). Using
/// `input + output` alone made the percentage bounce between "full
/// transcript" and "just the new delta" depending on whether the turn
/// hit the cache. The sum is the honest "how full is the window right
/// now?" read without tokenizing ourselves.
